README - PUMA

The Purdue University Motion Analysis (PUMA) system was developed to
digitize video so that could be analyzed frame by frame (actually,
field by field).  Analysis includes tracking many coordinates over time.

The result of the analysis is a sequence of coordinate matrices that can
analyzed for kinematics such as velocity, acceleration, and angular
momentum.  This work is in the VideoCapture directory.

When combined with forces associated with the motions, both the kinetics
and kinematics associated with the motion can be analyzed.
